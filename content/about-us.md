# About Us

{{< img class="img-wrap" alt="About Crown Homes, LLC" src="/images/crownover-family-c.jpg" >}}

You’d be hard pressed to find a time in JT Crownover’s life when he wasn’t carrying around a hammer, some nails and plenty of big ideas. From treehouses to go-karts, he spent most of his childhood building whatever he and his brothers could conjure up.

That love of building something better with his own two hands grew into jobs at a young age crafting custom doors and cabinets in a woodworking shop, working on home construction crews, and building pipelines with crews around the country.

But deep down, JT wanted to build homes. As he learned the needs and dreams of new home builders, JT felt the call to create his own company centered on customer service. Namely, JT decided that if someone put their trust in him to build their home, he would treat them with the same care and respect he would in building one for someone in his family.

In August, 2014, JT began Crown Homes, LLC with the goal of becoming one of the most respected home builders in Brandon, MS. Today, Crown Homes is one of the area’s most respected Rankin County homebuilders specializing in New Residential Homes, Custom Homes, New Homes For Sale and Real Estate focused in Rankin County.

JT and Jessica Crownover raise their three children in Brandon and continue to build their lives around supporting and serving families and businesses in the growing community they call home.
